# ResetEra Trips and Ticks

Here are some tips and tricks that can be used to make your ResetEra experience much more enjoyable.

## Adding the Announcements thread to your watch list

If you want to be notified of all forum announcements, just add [this thread](https://www.resetera.com/forums/announcements.2/) to your watch list (make sure you select the option of only getting notified when a new thread is added)!

## Adding Spoiler Previews

When writing a spoiler, you can add a preview which like so:

```
[SPOILER="You can leave a msg of what the spoiler contains."]Before you reveal it like david copperfield![/SPOILER]
```

This will then appear like this:
