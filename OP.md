# What is programming?


> Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language.


From Wikipedia.

Basically:

> Write instructions for a computer. Computer then follows those instructions

# Where do I start?

Here is a good place! Feel free to ask any questions, and we will gladly give advice.

It honestly depends what you are interested in, and what you intend to use the programming for. Programming as a skill is essentially the ability to use a wide range of tools adepts at completely different tasks - the skills are transferable, but the trains of thought can sometimes be completely different.

Python is great language to start with, and what I personally learnt first.

# What languages are there? What are they good for? How do I learn them?

## C

C is one of the oldest but most widely used languages out there. It's incredibly powerful and blindingly fast. Unfortunately, it can also be unwieldy, due to both being incredibly low-level, and having design that's decades old.

The Linux Kernel is written in C.

## C++

C++ is essentially C, but with loads of 'modern' (it started development in 1979) language features. It was originally designed to be compatible with C, but no longer strictly is.

Unfortunately, it suffers from a lot of the same problems that C does, design with, with a fair few problems of its own. But it's low level expressiveness, the power it provides, alongside the weird and wonderful/horrible template metaprogramming paradigm have made it the systems and applications programming language of choice for many people.

Oh, and most game engines are written in C++.

# Note

I will try to listen to any feedback to this OT, and add anything you feel is worthwhile! Especially with resources for learning programming languages, I really don't know what the best ones are!
